We thank the editorial team for accepting our paper. We have submitted the final version as instructed. We have added a few lines at the end of the manuscript (before the 'Acknowledgement' section) to cite a similar work published by Yang et al.(2022) in December 2022, which we missed during the manuscript preparation and review.
